# **Ladybug**

Ladybug is bug tracking app for all your project needs and is created by Dan Nguyen

Ladybug is an easy-to-use web application that uses full CRUD and follows MVC. Use the bug tracker to track your bugs throughout your projects.

## **Background**

"Bugs aren't the problem, they're features." In web development, we will always be working on projects, big and small, and in these projects will always have bugs. I wanted to create an app to be able to track my bugs. Software developers will always have them, so why not create an app to track them?

## **Technologies Used**

HTML | CSS | JavaScript | MongoDB | Express | React | Node.js | BootStrap | Heroku | Git | GitHub

## **Getting Started**

Click here to launch the app:
https://dannguyen-ladybug.herokuapp.com/

In Ladybug, you can create, read, update, and delete any of your bugs. If you are a new user, you must sign up first and then login. Once logged in, use the "New Bug" button on the navigation bar to add your first bug! Once created, you can click on your bug to see a summary of it. You can also edit and delete your bug. New features will be rolling out shortly.
